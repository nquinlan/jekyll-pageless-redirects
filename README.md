# Jekyll Pageless Redirects
Redirect any number of pages with one file. Supports htaccess style redirects.

**Note**: "Pageless" indicates you don't need to create new `_pages` or `_posts` to make the redirects occur. Pages are still generated and follow the tried and true `http-equiv="refresh"` method of redirection. _This means the plugin **will** work on Github pages or anywhere else that doesn't read .htaccess files._

## Usage
Install `pageless_redirects.rb` in your plugins directory (`_plugins` in vanilla Jekyll, `plugins` in Octopress).

To generate redirects create `_redirects.yml`, `_redirects.htaccess`, and/or `_redirects.json` in the Jekyll root directory. Both follow the pattern `alias`, `final destination`.

### Sample `_redirects.yml`

	initial-page   : /destination-page
	other-page     : http://example.org/destination-page
	"another/page" : /destination-page

#### Result

* Requests to `/initial-page` are redirected to `/destination-page`
* Requests to `/other-page` are redirected to `http://example.org/destination-page`
* Requests to `/another/page` are redirected to `/destination-page`

### Sample `_redirects.htaccess`

	Redirect /some-page /destination-page
	Redirect 301 /different-page /destination-page
	Redirect cool-page http://example.org/destination-page

#### Result

* Requests to `/some-page` are redirected to `/destination-page`
* Requests to `/different-page` are redirected to `/destination-page`
* Requests to `/cool-page` are redirected to `http://example.org/destination-page`

### Sample `_redirects.json`

	{
		"yolo": "/twerk",
		"loons": "/awesome"
	}

#### Result

* Requests to `/yolo` are redirected to `/twerk`
* Requests to `/loons` are redirected to `/awesome`
